It looks like you're working on a Smart Auto-Reply system for web-based chats, leveraging the Gemini 2.0 Flash model from Google Generative AI for reply suggestions. Your code snippet provides a solid starting point, and I’d love to help you flesh this out further! To make sure I’m aligned with your vision, I have a few questions to fill in the gaps and refine the app’s functionality:

### Clarify my Requirements:
1. **Chat Platforms**: I mentioned WhatsApp Web and Discord. Telegram Web. How do you plan to detect incoming messages (e.g., browser extensions,)?

2. **Conversation Context**:  AI should consider the full chat history for context,

3. **Response Styles**: I mentioned casual, professional, and humorous styles. Users should be able to switch styles dynamically during a conversation, or set a default style beforehand.

4. **Frontend Integration**: You mentioned an `env.js` file for frontend config (dev vs. prod). How do you envision the UI—e.g., a floating suggestion box and inline reply options. Should suggestions appear in real-time as the user types and after a message is received?

5. **Customization**: Beyond response styles, I want users to customize the tone further (e.g., “short and snappy” vs. “detailed and polite”) or train the AI with personal examples?

6. **Backend Setup**: my code ia to be Node.js-based. Are you planning to host this as a server-side app (e.g., Express.js) that the frontend calls via API,

7. **Output Handling**: The code includes logic for handling inline data (e.g., images). i expect the AI to generate media-based replies?  the app should support sending images/PDFs as replies?

use mongodb as the database for storing user preferences and chat history.
use gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation model for image generation and google 2.0 flash for text generation.

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1 Architecture
- **Frontend**: Browser extension written in JavaScript, housed in the `extension/` folder.
- **Backend**: Node.js-based server-side app (Express.js) with MongoDB, housed in the `backend/` folder.
- **Communication**: RESTful API between the extension and backend for real-time suggestion generation and data storage.

### 3.2 Frontend (Extension)
- **Folder**: `extension/`
- **Tech Stack**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM manipulation.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Message Listener**: Use MutationObserver to detect new messages in real-time on supported platforms.
  - **UI**: Floating suggestion box and inline options with “click-to-send” buttons.
  - **Config**: `env.js` file for environment-specific settings (dev vs. prod).
    ```javascript
    // extension/env.js
    const env = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? { apiUrl: 'https://replygenie-api.com', apiKey: 'prod-placeholder' }
      : { apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', apiKey: 'dev-placeholder' };
    export default env;
    ```

### 3.3 Backend
- **Folder**: `backend/`
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Google Generative AI SDK.
- **Key Components**:
  - **API Endpoints**:
    - `POST /suggest`: Generate text/image reply suggestions.
    - `GET /history`: Retrieve chat history for context.
    - `POST /schedule`: Schedule a message.
    - `PUT /preferences`: Update user styles, tones, and triggers.
  - **AI Models**:
    - Text generation: `gemini-2.0-flash`.
    - Image generation: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation`.
  - **Database**: MongoDB for storing:
    - User preferences (styles, tones, triggers).
    - Chat history (for context).
    - Scheduled messages.

- **Sample Backend Code**:
  ```javascript
  // backend/index.js
  const express = require('express');
  const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require('@google/generative-ai');
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');
  require('dotenv').config();

  const app = express();
  app.use(express.json());

  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
  const textModel = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash' });
  const imageModel = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation' });

  mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true });

  app.post('/suggest', async (req, res) => {
    const { message, history, style, tone, includeImage } = req.body;
    const chatSession = textModel.startChat({ history });
    const prompt = `Respond in a ${style} tone (${tone}): ${message}`;
    const result = await chatSession.sendMessage(prompt);
    const suggestions = [result.response.text()];

    if (includeImage) {
      const imageResult = await imageModel.generateContent(prompt);
      suggestions.push({ type: 'image', data: imageResult.response.data });
    }

    res.json({ suggestions });
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Backend running on port 3000'));
  ```

### 3.4 Database Schema (MongoDB)
- **User Collection**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "defaultStyle": "string (casual/professional/humorous)",
    "customTones": ["string"],
    "triggers": [{ "keyword": "string", "response": "string" }],
    "trainingExamples": ["string"]
  }
  ```
- **Chat History Collection**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "platform": "string (whatsapp/discord/telegram)",
    "history": [{ "role": "user/model", "text": "string", "timestamp": "date" }]
  }
  ```
- **Scheduled Messages Collection**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "recipient": "string",
    "scheduleTime": "date"
  }
  ```

### 3.5 Performance
- Reply suggestions should be generated within 1-2 seconds to ensure a seamless real-time experience.
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed user preferences and recent chat history.

## 4. Implementation Guidelines
1. **Folder Structure**:
   ```
   ReplyGenie/
   ├── extension/
   │   ├── env.js
   │   ├── manifest.json
   │   ├── content.js (message detection and UI)
   │   └── popup.html/css/js (settings UI)
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── index.js (Express server)
   │   ├── models/ (MongoDB schemas)
   │   ├── routes/ (API endpoints)
   │   └── .env (API keys, MongoDB URI)
   ```

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Start with the extension’s message detection and basic suggestion UI.
   - Build the backend API with text generation first, then add image support.
   - Integrate MongoDB for persistence and test additional features (scheduling, triggers).

3. **Security**:
   - Store API keys in `.env` (backend) and avoid hardcoding in the extension.
   - Use HTTPS for API communication in production.

---

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 1,000 active users within 3 months of launch.
- **Engagement**: 80% of users use reply suggestions at least once per session.
- **Performance**: 95% of suggestions generated within 2 seconds.

---

## 6. Open Questions
1. Should the extension support multi-user accounts (e.g., different profiles per browser)?
2. Do you want a premium tier with advanced features (e.g., more training data, priority support)?
3. Any specific UI design preferences (e.g., color scheme, layout)?

---

Let me know if you’d like me to expand on any section, provide more code samples, or start prototyping a specific part (e.g., the extension’s `content.js` or backend API)! What do you think of "ReplyGenie" as the name?
Additionally, the extension code should be written in the `extension/` folder and backend code in the `backend/` folder.
Write this in the format of a detailed PRD. Suggest a better name for the browser extension, such as "ChatAssist" or "ReplyGenie".
