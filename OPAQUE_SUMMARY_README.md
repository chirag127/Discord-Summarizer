# Discord Summarizer - Opaque Summary Display Update

This update improves the visibility of summaries in Discord by making them fully opaque and more visually distinct.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fully Opaque Summaries

- **Before**: Summaries had some transparency, making them harder to read
- **After**: All summaries are now fully opaque with improved contrast

### 2. Enhanced Visual Styling

- Added stronger box shadows for better visual separation
- Improved background colors for better readability
- Added a border between the header and content
- Increased text contrast for better visibility

### 3. Consistent Behavior

- Both unread and recent message summaries now have consistent opacity
- The styling differences between the two types are now more intentional:
  - Unread messages: Blue left border
  - Recent messages: Green left border

### 4. Improved Logging

- Added additional console logging to help troubleshoot display issues

## Technical Implementation

1. Added `opacity: 1 !important` to force full opacity on all summary elements
2. Updated background colors to ensure proper contrast
3. Added border-bottom to the header for better visual separation
4. Changed text color to pure white for better readability
5. Added console logging to track which message selection type is being used

## Benefits

- **Better Readability**: Text is now easier to read with improved contrast
- **Visual Clarity**: Summaries stand out better against Discord's background
- **Consistent Experience**: Both summary types have a consistent, professional appearance
- **Better Debugging**: Added logging makes it easier to troubleshoot display issues

## How to Test

1. **For Unread Messages**:
   - Find a Discord channel with unread messages
   - Click the "Summarize" button in the chat
   - Verify the summary appears with a blue border and is fully opaque

2. **For Recent Messages**:
   - Open the extension popup
   - Select "Recent Messages" from the dropdown
