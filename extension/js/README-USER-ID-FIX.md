# Discord Summarizer Fix - User ID Parsing

## Issue Fixed

This update fixes an issue with the Discord user ID parsing in the extension. The error was:

```
Error getting Discord user ID: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '', "ÜÌ¡" is not valid JSON
```

## Changes Made

1. Enhanced the `getDiscordUserId()` function in `content.js` to:
   - Add proper base64 padding to the JWT token payload
   - Handle URL-safe base64 encoding
   - Validate the decoded payload before parsing as JSON
   - Add multiple fallback mechanisms to get the user ID
   - Generate a temporary user ID if all methods fail

## How to Test

1. Load the updated extension in Chrome
2. Navigate to Discord in your browser
3. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Check for any errors related to "Error getting Discord user ID"
5. Try using the summarize feature to ensure it works properly

## Additional Testing

You can also run the included test script to verify the fix:

1. Open Discord in your browser
2. Open the browser console (F12)
3. Copy and paste the contents of `test-user-id.js` into the console
4. Press Enter to run the test
5. Check the console output to see if a user ID was successfully retrieved

## Fallback Behavior

If the extension cannot parse your Discord token to get your user ID, it will:
1. Try to find the user ID in other Discord data sources
2. If all else fails, generate a temporary user ID that persists in localStorage
3. This temporary ID allows the extension to work even without access to your real Discord user ID

The temporary ID will be prefixed with `temp_` and will be used consistently across sessions.
